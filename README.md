This contains code and data for comparing numbers of police officer deaths in Terre Haute, Indiana to departments around the US. For details see [this post](https://alanjern.github.io/post/three-police-offers-have-died-in-terre-haute-in-the-last-10-years.-is-that-a-lot/).

The script I used for scraping the police deaths is in the `data` folder.
